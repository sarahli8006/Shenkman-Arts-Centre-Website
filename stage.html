        <p>Stage Crew members go through training to be able to fulfill their responsabilities safely. After training,
          volunteers will initially work as assistants or stagehands. Progression to operators or lead hands is
          dependent on the volunteer experience and level of training.</p>

      <p>Safety is of prime consideration when working on stage and is emphasized in all training sessions. All new
        volunteers are required to participate in a series of basic training sessions. The first, Backstage 360ยบ, is a
        required orientation that must be taken prior to the other courses. The remaining introductory courses cover
        Staging Principles, Introduction to Lighting and Introduction to Audio, and will qualify the volunteer to work
        as a stagehand and / or assistant. As the Stage Crew member gains experience with the crew, he or she may wish
        to acquire more specialized knowledge by participating in training sessions on advanced audio and lighting,
        rigging operation and stage management.</p>

    <div class="item" data-aos="fade-right">
      <p>The basic crew commitment is eight hours per month. However, the amount of time a volunteer actually works in a
        month is dependent on his or her interest and the shows, training and activities scheduled in a month. Crew
        members are provided with appropriate food and beverages should they work a shift that extends over normal meal
        periods.</p><br><br><br>
